> Create colourful, animated GIFs from images, text and emoji to get your message across on social media.

Inspired by tools like Pablo and Peach, Shout is a simple web app designed to inspire creativity. The limitations of the canvas inspire creative use of formatting, colour and emoji to get a message across.

The project let me experiment with HTML canvas, Web Workers and blob storage. It also allowed for some relatively deep investigation into GIF processing and generation using Javascript.

## Interface design

<img alt="Shout Screenshot" src="/pages/portfolio/shout/shoutapp.png"/>

I wanted Shout's creation interface to be extremely simple, just like creating a basic slideshow presentation. Customisation is limited to bring out creativity. This also means the barrier to entry is minimal. 

For onboarding, I allow the interface to describe itself with placeholders encouraging action and default styles subtly hinting at the customisation available. With that introduction, the user is left to explore and create.

## Branding

<img src="/pages/portfolio/shout/shoutbranding.png"/>

The branding for shout needed to reflect that it is a simple tool. It doesn't have very much personality and it doesn't feel too friendly. Its brand is intended to reflect that it is a reliable tool for social media.
