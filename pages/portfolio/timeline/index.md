> Keep memories alive in a timeline of events with images and stories which you can share with friends and family.

I built the Timeline web app with plain HTML, CSS and JS with jQuery. All styling is custom, taking significant guidance from Material Design. Of course, the web app is also responsive and mobile-installable.

The most enjoyable part of the project was building a time travel interaction to jump along the timeline using a bar of dates. Itâ€™s more fun than it sounds, so you should probably sign up, add some events from your life and try it out.
