Value proposition:

> Make your scheduling more efficient with your work chat and schedule side by side, on your whole team's phones.

I worked as part of the wonderful Yavi product team to take the iOS and Android apps from MVP to release in 3 months, with a focus on increasing re-engagement through a messaging interface.

We are now releasing updates regularly for our growing userbase. I am using user research to understand communication needs in a work environment and designing systems to make enterprise communication feel simple.

## Illustrations

I produced illustrations to assist with user understanding across Yavi mobile and web products. You can see even more by trying it out.
