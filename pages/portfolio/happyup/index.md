> Keep happy moments in mind. Collect your favourite happy moments each day. Reflect to make yourself smile.

I developed the initial concept of Happy Up, a simple app designed to reduce the impact of negative thinking through cognitive dissonance. My goal was to evoke emotions of comfort and friendliness, while ensuring the app felt like a private space – a tool rather than a system or persona.

This lovely app was built in collaboration with Kristi Kelly ([YouHue](http://youhue.com)) and Stéphane Copin ([Fueled](https://fueled.com/stephane-copin)).
