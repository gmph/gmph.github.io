As I mentioned in my last note, [Designing Messaging](http://gmph.co/designing-messaging), I have been working at Yavi for the past two months with an awesome team building a messaging app for shift-workers. In the short time I have been at Yavi, I have had a chance to go deeper in design research than I ever had in the past. One of those aras of research is user testing.

I've spoken to over 20 users in formal interviews with Yavi's Product Owner, Tadas, and other members of the team.
