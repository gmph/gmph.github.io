- graphic ltr timeline concept with dots, next dot
- introduction
	- took me a while to settle on a job I wanted to do, but now I have found it and it is definitely sticking 
- past experience freelancing
	- in school, moved from writing to design
	- 16-19 working for myself
	- started dev work slightly
- past experience at university
	- computer science in edinburgh
	- missed working in a production environment
	- learned I have a need for pragmatism
		- need to see what I build being useful
		- have a focus on helping people in meaningful ways
		- quick example: shout gif app is practical and I learnt a lot from it
	- I thought I could find something better for me
- snipandshare
	- my first try in a full-time team
	- in a production environment just like I wanted, in at the deep end
	- learnt a lot
	 	- front-end development
	 		- thanks to marjan and boris
	 		- deploying live code for second startup
	 	- ios design of two apps
	 		- not released
	 		- learned a lot about exploration and experiments
	- trips and experiences
		- india with team
			- out of my comfort zone
			- country and culture, and elephants
			- time out to think about the big picture
		- web summit
			- again, out of my comfort zone
			- time in the city
			- working together in person (wanted more of that)
			- learning from customers
		- time to move on to push myself and keep learning
- yavi
	- I quickly realised one place I could find this was with yavi
	- problem space
		- messaging for irl connected people
		- team communication for work
		- mobile platform focus
		- intention to delight
		- cutting edge of messaging and bot tech
	- team
		- kotikan mobile dev agency founder and team
		- fanduel mobile app creators
		- perudo championship in the office
		- being there in person makes a big difference
			- speed problem solving
			- clarity of discussions
			- without sacrificing flexible hours
	- I have been with yavi for about a month and a half now, and it hasnt disappointed
	- so far
		- when I start a new job I seem to have a spurt of learning and growth
		- push myself to learn and be effective with new challenges
		- feel this learning and it's great, and I want to ensure it doesn't stop
- expecting in the future
	- much more learning to do
	- bringing a mainstream product to market
- short outro
	- see a solid future thanks to team and idea
	- excited for the future
