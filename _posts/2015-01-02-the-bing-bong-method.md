![The Bing Bong Method]({{ site.url }}/res/posts/bingbong.png)

Being a politician in a genuine democracy is entirely troublesome. One must appear to represent their constituents. One must learn policies from their advisors. One must communicate their talking points to the media. All with more grace and fewer stutters than even the most talented Hollywood performer.

This short guide will help you, dear politician, to realise your dream of not being abused by the public or choreographed from your job for answering a question genuinely. Shall we begin?

The first rule when having a conversation with the media is that you should never have that conversation. To this end, the most effective technique we have developed is the Bing Bong Method. You're in a supermarket:

1. A staff member behind the till pushes the tannoy button.
2. They hear it make a meaningless noise: Bing, bong!
3. The staff member then gives their message.

When you're with the media, you should put yourself in the mindset of the tannoy operator. The way you speak should be exactly like the supermarket staff member making an announcement with the machine. No matter how personal and human your conversation may be, remember you are a tannoy operator.

1. You engage with the media; have an interview.
2. You hear a meaningless noise: the media asks a question.
3. You give your rehearsed, scripted message.

To reiterate this point: you must hear all media questions as a blank cue to talk on the subject of your choice and nothing else.

Because we have been using this technique for so long, we can actually invert it to our own advantage. If you want to seem  honest when being interviewed, all you must do is answer briefly and clearly. The public is so familiar with the monotonous tannoy that anything different will excite them. If you really want to shock the public into thinking you're a real person, try saying a simple “Yes.” or “No.” and see what happens.

Much like the staff member operating the tannoy in a supermarket, you must know who your audience is. Staff announcement. Customer announcement. These apply in politics too. Remember who your audience is when you speak through the media. If you want to keep your backbenchers on side, your staff announcement should include hints that you're listening to them. If you are talking to the customers (in politics ‘customers’ is as valid as ‘electorate’), use the grand language polling prefers.

Trying to talk in this way is daunting at first. You will worry that the media will take advantage of and spin what you say. Thankfully, in our wonderful democracy, if you keep to the party line and speak to the right journalists, you'll find navigating the media as simple as pushing that tannoy button.

Bing, bong! And our message is out there.

PREVIOUS DRAFT:

## The First Rule

The first rule of this guide is to never say anything of substance. A core skill of enacting this is to reduce any probing questions regarding implementation and details – the 'how' – of policies back to simplistic and friendly descriptions of them – the 'what'.

For the majority of questions, your talking points will guide you. In order to use a talking point without seeming to stray away from the question it is necessary to extract a single detail of the question and use it to flow from the question into your talking point.

For example, if you are asked:

>This decision by the union is one which has affected many schools. You're a parent yourself. Have you and your family personally been affected by the decision to strike and are your children seeing a difference at their school?

This question is clearly malicious. Your children don't go to that indigent state school which the unions are targeting so any mention of your own children or the effect on you personally will result in you being questioned further and attacked. The key point to pick up on here would be the idea of 'parents'. You might say:

>I think parents up and down the country will be feeling the effects of this action by the union, and for those parents I can only sincerely encourage both parties to get back round the negotiating table and... [insert further talking points here].

This main rule will help you avoid most questions, but when an interviewer is intent on asking about facts and figures you will need even more ways to shake them off and get back to what you want to say – what you need to say to keep your job.

## “Evidence shows that...”

When you're speaking in public, ensure you do not commit yourself to any specifics, details or ideas. Commit yourself to certain unsourced evidence which you can later claim to be at fault. For example, when talking about the consequences of there being no GPs open at the weekend, one should say:

>I think there is evidence that shows if you are admitted – if you need something serious done, an operation – at the weekend then your chances of survival can be less.

This means that one never has to have a full or reasoned view on a topic because as long as you can find a single piece of evidence to support your misinformation, your statement will hold true. Blaming the evidence you were supplied is a simple way to avoid the horror of having to be responsible when informing the public.

In Parliament, MPs have this down to a near-mastered art. At the dispatch box, the Government and Opposition can cheerily run off completely contradictory sets of evidence and not worry about their accuracy. “You reduced spending for X,” the Opposition cry, evidence in hand. “I think you'll find we're increasing it!” the Government retort, waving evidence back confidently. Both sit back down comfortably behind their thick binders, themselves unsure if they are correct about the matter.

There is always evidence to support your point – never fear!

## “_X_ said that...”

Another delightfully effective way to protect yourself from needing a concrete view is to refer to someone else's. There are two ways to do this: one is a agree with the view of an ally who has previously spoken; the other is to disagree with the view of an opponent.

In order to make talking points less obvious, it's important to refer to other people. For example, you might say:

>And that's why I think it's so important that we support the Chancellor when he says moving to a high pay, low tax, lower welfare economy and having a strong economy are the most important factors in protecting [insert literally anything here].

This makes the response seem much more like a quote than a restating of party talking points. Additionally, it moves the focus of questioning away from you to the person you have quoted. This particular technique links to the following one very well.

Using this as a way to highlight your opposition's policies' flaws can also be effective. For example, if asked about your policy on child benefit, you could say:

>Well I can tell you what my policy would not be: it would not be to take child benefit, a vital life line, away from the poorest families across the country. It would not be to target the poorest in society and balance the books on their backs, which the Chancellor seems so set on doing with his tax credit cuts.



## “You'd have to ask _X_...”

Once you have brought the line of questioning away from yourself, you can often find it easier to deflect questions colleagues, experts or ministers. If in any way you can relate a question to someone else, you can name that person and pass the question to them. Of course if that person isn't available to comment that's even better.

As an example, if you were asked about the government's Draft Communications Data Bill and had no talking points on the matter, you might say:

>I'm sure you know the Home Secretary has been doing a thorough job of negotiating this issue and introducing this Bill. You'd really have to ask her about the specific details of how the Bill is proceeding through the House and I'm sure she would welcome an interview to share its progress.

This can also be used as a powerful sarcastic response when criticising your opposition. For example, if asked what you thought about the comments _X_ made about _Y_:

>I'm afraid I haven't discussed or seen in detail _X_'s position on this. You would have to ask _X_ directly about _X_'s thoughts on _Y_ to clarify the matter with them and discuss that view.

Identically to the first example, you say very little about the real issue. All you reveal is that the journalist should be talking to someone else about this issue and you have nothing to say. These hints are usually picked up on and the interviewer will move on to a question for which you have talking points or probe further.

If asked again “Yes, but what do you personally think about the criticisms in terms of liberty and freedom of speech the Bill has faced?” it is very easy to follow the same response:

>As I said, the Home Secretary has been doing a thorough job of negotiating this issue and introducing this Bill. You'd really...

As long as you can answer confidently and combine this with other techniques, you can appear to be rather consistent, informed and authoritative by answering in this way – somehow the audience will often fall for that facade.

## “The real question is...”

When you're facing a particularly impolite interviewer who insists on asking in-depth questions, it is always important to have a way out. When discussions get detailed, take a step back – back to your talking points. The classic phrasing of this technique is: "The real question is [insert question which is not the real question here]."

Some of our talented linguists have developed new variations of this to provide some diversity in your speeches. There are two other effective forms. "What the good people really want to know is..." is effective when talking about an emotive topic. It's a good way to redirect to public opinion and away from solid facts.

"If we stand back and look at the big picture..." is the perfect statement to return to higher level discussions which better suit your talking points. Similarly to the 'good people' version, this also returns to the simpler thoughts in the minds of the general public.

## “The wording of that question...”

attack the question

## “I'll get to that question if you let me finish...”

## Appendix A: Useful Phrases

**“I think it is right that...”**

This phrase is extremely useful for convincing the audience that there is a moral consideration in what you are saying. It also performs well in suggesting ambiguity when read back in a different tone. In focus groups, this performs particularly well on issues regarding the NHS and welfare (when issues are complicated but you want to seem moral).

**“Let me be clear...”**

The fact of the matter is that politics is a game. -->
