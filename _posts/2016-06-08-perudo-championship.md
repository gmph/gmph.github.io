After writing about [designing an interactive messaging app with bots]({{ site.url }}/designing-messaging) and [user research at Yavi]({{ site.url }}/first-user-testing), I thought it might be good to share a more fun thought in this note.

When we have lunch each day at the Yavi office, we play games. Our games of choice are King of Tokyo, Exploding Kittens, Settlers of Katan, Super Fight and Perudo. We have a clear favourite.

Most days we play Perudo at least once. We have a championship. We have set rules about recording scoring. We have a spreadsheet to track our results. We have a trophy for the winner each season. It's fun though, honest!
