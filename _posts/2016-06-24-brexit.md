I don’t understand why people voted for Brexit.

Trying to dissect how I feel about the EU referendum is not easy. At first I thought it was not an important issue to be debated. I was happy with the status quo. I voted for the UK to remain in the EU. Only after seeing the winning Leave result did I realised that, somehow, it is an important debate.

My home local authority, [Moray]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/brexit_moray.png){:target="_blank"}, gave the most evenly split vote in the whole of the UK. The people voted by 50.13% to remain in the EU. Notably, this made it the most pro-Brexit area in Scotland. The local authority I live and work in, [Edinburgh]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/brexit_edinburgh.png){:target="_blank"}, was the most pro-remain area in Scotland, with a 74.44% majority for staying in the EU. I hope the comparison between these two areas can help me to understand the Brexit vote. 

Some voter demographic data published by the Guardian provides a more objective view. Because these graphs are grouped by area, there is a degree of uncertainty but they show a general trend.

Comparing the areas I know, it’s clear that they follow the general trends visible in the graphs. The less well-off and older you are, the more likely you are to vote for Brexit. This seems to indicate that those who are not well-off in society and are less educated see the EU as the source of some pain.

Some common arguments that I have heard are:

- We send lots of money to the EU and it would be better spent in our own country on things like the NHS
- The EU has allowed too much migration and migrants are undercutting British workers
- There are not enough school places or houses because there are too many people in the country because of migration

These are all tangible effects which Leave voters feel. Their attribution is subjective, and that is where I disagree. 

When I see money going to the EU I think that it is going to a good causes: promoting equality through level and fair trading agreements, encouraging policies to tackle climate change, funding the parliament to support open dialogue between all EU nations, etc. 

I suppose that Leave-supporters do not see these big-picture factors as being so key as I do. They see money going to the EU and not coming back – [about £8.5bn per year](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/){:target="_blank"}. They do not feel any direct benefit from the UK’s membership fee paid to the EU. They do not see services being funded in their local area. In fact, they see them being cut. They do not see policy benefits, they just hear about seemingly silly regulations. They do not see any benefits from free movement, only people taking their jobs. Their perspective is completely different.

Arguably I do not see these benefits directly either. The difference is that I have been lucky enough not to face significant struggles financially or socially. I have not been badly affected by spending cuts or had my wages undercut.

However, I would also suggest that those who voted Leave have likely not experienced adversity due to the EU either.

In or out of the EU, we would have the same problems. Immigration is high because it benefits our economy and one of the Government's jobs is to protect the county's economy. Wages are undercut because companies are trying to make a profit and they will exploit wage compression. The NHS is not well-funded because the Government is attempting to reduce spending to manoeuvre to a better financial position. All of our ills are not caused by one organisation; they are caused by the political and social system we live in.

Here is what I understand about the vote for Brexit: The worst-off people in society are understandably angry. They felt like politicians weren't listening to them. They cast a protest vote against what the saw as establishment politicians working together. This referendum was not at its heart about the EU.

## Version 4

Those who are not well-off in society are not treated well. Public services, housing and the labour market do not work for them. An ugly fact about a society based on freely trading scarce resources is that some people have to be dealt a bad hand. This is the problem that all governments, at any level, are faced with. They do not have unlimited resources and they cannot help everyone even if they wanted to. Nor can they take the pressure of the public blaming them for all their ills. In seeking a scapegoat, they turn to other bodies like the EU or other people like immigrants. The government wrestles with redistribution of wealth in a system that is against it.




## Version 1

I'm sitting on the bus. Out one window there is rain and out the other there is sun. The contrast is stunning. Today my country chose the rain and the storm.

## Version 2

Yesterday, the people of the United Kingdom voted for the country to leave the European Union in a referendum. In the in-out vote, the majority for leave was 51.9% against 49.1% remain. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced in the morning after the result was confirmed that he would step down as Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in October, giving time for the economy to regain some stability.

In my home constituency, the split of the vote was closer than any other constituency in the UK, sitting at 50.1% remain and 49.9% leave. This underlines the division I think we are feeling in society now. 

Many of the milder bad things campaigners for the In campaign warned of are now suddenly going to be our reality.

I am slightly dumbfounded by the result. The majority of people in the United Kingdom believe that the UK is better off outside the EU. All I can try to do is understand their logic, or their feelings.

The slogan of the Vote Leave campaign was "take back control". This is the starting point for their argument. It splits into several things the EU influences:

- Spending of the EU Membership Fee
- Immigration and border policy
- Laws and statutes from the EU

These things again filter down to tangible grievances people may have:

- Low spending on the NHS
- High immigration figures
- Seemingly increasing threats to national security
- Persistent cuts to spending on public services
- A lack of affordable housing
- EU regulations forced on small businesses

People who hold some anger about these issues may see a link back up to the control taken away from the UK Parliament and Government by the EU.

I have empathy for the frustrations with these lower level problems people are experiencing. I am lucky enough to not have been badly affected by them personally, but I can understand the anger.

Moving up to the second level of connection is where the argument falls down for me. While I believe the issues are real, I do not attribute them to EU immigration, EU laws or EU spending. To make this jump, you would have to believe that the UK government is weak. Only a weak legislative body could not have any power to change things. I struggle to see that. 

My political and social beliefs and demographic probably bias me towards thinking the UK Government is not weak. Being a socially progressive, pragmatic socialist (if that's a description you can make sense of), I have seen the UK government impose laws and regulations which I am strongly against. I have seen successive governments for years fail to tackle inequality in society and prevent financial wrongdoings by the wealthy. As a Scot, I have seen parties elected at Westminster to govern my country, while its population voted against them. I do not believe the UK Government lacks power.

Generally, the less well-off and older you are, the more likely you were to vote for Brexit.
