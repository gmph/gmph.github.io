My blog has been preventing me from writing. I don't think that's what a blog should do. Three, four, five complete articles sit in front of me yet none of them are up to my publishing standard. No new articles in three months. This isn't how it should be.

So, say hello to notes. Notes are a way for me to publish on my blog without worrying. I can go wild.

Look at that garbage.

I could never publish an article with that. But I can leave this lovely, low-quality note for you to read. Ah, freedom.
