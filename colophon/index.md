## Author

This blog was written, designed and coded by Graham Macphee. It was mainly written in and published from Edinburgh, Scotland. More information about Graham can be found on [the front page](http://gmph.co), and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gmph). Graham has also written for other online publications, including reviews for [UltraLinx](http://theultralinx.com), design critique for [UltraUI](http://ui.theultralinx.com) and editorials for [Femsplain](http://femsplain.com).

## Design

The blog's design is based on Graham's minimalistic typographic style. With a focus on openness and whitespace, the design uses a simple pairing of Helvetica Neue and Libre Baskerville. It uses the vibrant colours <code style="background:#8B67FF;color:#fff">#8B67FF</code> and <code style="background:#55FFC7;color:#fff">#55FFC7</code> throughout. The purple is intended to reflect a sense of depth, formality and boldness while the turquoise represents happiness, openness and freshness.

## Brand

The logo used in this blog is Graham Macphee's personal logomark. The mark conveys the shape of Graham's initials, with the round circle shape following the outer curve of the “G” and the sharp sides of the tilted square mimicking an “M”. The logomark is also the basis of a logo system, including article illustrations.

The illustrations in this blog are based on the logomark, with each one's subtle variations in colour, shape and arrangement presenting itself as an abstract form of the article's subject. The illustrations are used as an introduction to the feel and theme of each article.
