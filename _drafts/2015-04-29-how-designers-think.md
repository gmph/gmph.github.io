Great designers are masters of understanding how people think and how they interpret stimuli. They use this to create an&nbsp;experience or draw&nbsp;a reaction.&nbsp;Recently I have come to realise several things about design which I hadn't considered before, and these things have changed my outlook on it as an art and as a function for communication.

Humans are a bit weird. We are influenceable, emotional, and always&nbsp;think subjectively. Cognitively, we are great at thinking in abstract ways and generalising to find patterns.&nbsp;Because we have developed with a high dependence on the visual aspects of our world, we can process simple visuals in amazing ways. A sketch on paper can be modelled into an entire living scene in our minds; a single squiggle of writing on a page can be transformed into a complex concept; and, most interesting to me, a set of objectively meaningless shapes on a screen can become an intuitive opportunity to interact with information and with other people.

Designers play with our common understanding of visual elements to provide&nbsp;additional meaning and depth in the form of interaction. Speaking broadly and historically, this has been one-sided. Stage performance was formerly interactive to an extent, though this has been&nbsp;replaced by&nbsp;books and films which have&nbsp;a clear creator-audience dynamic, in which the audience is a dumb receiver. Physical products have always allowed interactivity but their properties are, of course, bound by the laws of physics. This is one of the things which makes digital design exciting: it gives the audience a voice and allows them to participate. This&nbsp;text on your screen – look at it fade in and fling around as you scroll, free from physical limitations. That's something that couldn't be recreated in&nbsp;other media. Digital design allows for motion, reaction, animation, extraphysical properties and unprecedented scalability. These all allow the experiences we can create with digital products to play more with human expectations of interaction and expand the possibilities design can create.

### “A good musician knows the more abstract structure of their art, and how to make beautiful patterns of sound which anyone can appreciate with ease.”

Designers can now produce even more engaging and effective experiences for people. I focus on experiences within mobile and web contexts (apps and websites). Designing these requires an understanding of when we should use expectations of solid, real-world properties (e.g. when information must have a clear structure or an action must be intuitive) and when we can avoid them (e.g. when the reaction of an element is supposed to delight or surprise). This is just one skill of this kind. More generally this comes down to knowing that design involves structure and abstracting representations. An app’s interface has rhythm just like a song or a sentence, and being able to ‘feel’ when a design is good naturally comes from this. In music, we all have our preferences, but a good musician knows the more abstract structure of their art, and how to make beautiful patterns of sound which anyone can appreciate with ease. This is what digital designers aim to do with visual experiences and interactions.

## Case Study: My New Portfolio

To explain some of this design thinking a little further and to give an example of the abstraction I am discussing, I’ll work through a real example. Let’s take the general formula for a song: verses with choruses between and a common rhythm and timing. Now let’s look at one of my most recent designs: [my new portfolio](grahammacphee.co.uk).

[![Portfolio Music Analysis (Image)](https://40.media.tumblr.com/4c01bf911675f2b19dab5d4eec4eeb61/tumblr_nludbae0Hi1rk6vlyo2_1280.png)](http://grahammacphee.co.uk)

As you can see, the layout is linear, just as a song is through time. Generally the size of the sections within it is regular, which gives a sense of common timing and pace, just like a song.

It has a fixed header with a photo of me, my name and a button. This serves as a constant element much like percussion in a song. It is there throughout to give context and structure and would only be removed if special emphasis was being put on the rest of the content (like a break for a solo vocal part in music or a fullscreen image in design).

Following down the page we see a single project element with a title, description and image. This is our introductory verse, giving an idea of a common structure but remaining unique in its content.

After this we have the chorus: a block of text on a light background. This is a simpler section and its content is much more distinct than the verse’s.

Below, we have several more project elements, or verses, of the same structure as the first, but notice that their colours are different, indicating different associated ideas. These are like the verses of a song. Together they tell a story (of my recent work) but alone they are all different.

As you can see, this simple pattern continues for the whole page, which concludes with a very simple footer and lots of whitespace – a clean ending to our little song.

While my portfolio is far from complex, it gives a good idea of how these seemingly unrelated arts can be connected by understanding their abstract patterns and structures. This is what designers do all the time, and it is what you do without realising it. When an app feels easy to use, a large part of that is because of these abstract structures which you understand and find easy to process. This is why things like the hamburger menu (the three lines in the top-left of an app which open the menu) catch on and why it feels so natural to use.

One thing digital design and digital form factors can offer that other media cannot is interactivity. When you hover over a project in my portfolio, it springs to life (a little). This reaction is designed to delight the interactor (the person interacting) and make them want to engage further with the content. These things are unique to digital design and they allow us to bring new properties to elements. Through animation we can make elements come to life and give them personality, whether this be bouncy and friendly or bold and corporate. This is only the first level of interactivity – _element interaction_. We also have _area interaction_, which is the ability of the interactor to change the area of our experience they are interacting with (e.g. clicking the ‘Me’ tab on Twitter will let you see your profile, a different area of the experience). Higher still we have _information interaction_ which is the more general ability of a person to access and modify data which may affect multiple people at once (e.g. writing a comment on Facebook). These aren’t standard terms but I believe they allow us to think of the different levels quite well. Each of these different types of interaction is much more powerful in digital design than other media.&nbsp;

I have realised that when I design, I take each of these into account and focus my designs around making each level of interaction the best it can be. This is why I take time when coding for the web to focus on CSS transitions first, then event animations, followed by any data changes for the screen. This is common practise, but defining each type of interaction allows me to better justify the code for it – it lets you say that a specific ‘:hover’ line of CSS code is used for a specific element interaction which has a specific effect and presents the experience in a specific way to the interactor; rather than just that&nbsp;“it looks good”. Understanding these interactions has helped me to work more effectively with motion in my work and to think about structure in a more abstract way.

This idea of abstraction is one which I have known about for some time. After a few cognitive science lectures it was beginning to sink in. However, only now have I begun to understand how it can be applied to design and used to improve the way we create experiences with digital products. Digital design is something which is unchallenged in terms of its ability to grow and change over time. This allows digital experiences (currently predominantly apps and websites) to include an ever broadening range of interactions. The end results of this is that designers can help people understand complex actions on data, as well as take knowledge or joy from those interactions.

Humans are a bit weird, and design lets us play with our brains’ weird systems for understanding the world to create new experiences.
