![Mental Health and Me]({{ site.url }}/res/posts/brain.png)

I've been doing this all wrong. Whenever I consider writing about a topic that matters to me I turn to statistics to back up my feelings and help people understand why they should care. It doesn't work as well as I want it to. So here are some words – just my words.

Mental health disorders have affected me and the people around me which I care about most for some time. It's something I have only talked about with a few people, but I feel like we (all of us) need to discuss these issues more widely. I'm going to talk about my experiences of mental health issues and my understanding of how important these issues and their treatment is today.

I'll split this article into four parts so you can find what you're looking for, and avoid what may be triggring:

1. [My Experience of Depression and Anxiety](#experience)
2. [You're Not Alone, and Here's Why](#notalone)

<h2 id="experience">1. My Experience of Depression and Anxiety</h2>

When I talk to new people one of the things I now commonly ask  is if they have experienced any mental health issues and if they are happy. These questions – which started as a way for me to try to learn how to be happy myself and how to understand how I was feeling when affected by depression or anxiety – are now a routine part of me getting to know new people. I ask these questions because I understand (at least a little) what it is like to have an issue you feel like you can't talk about. I want to play my own small role in normalising discussion about them.

My own experience of mental health problems aren't something I can define easily, nor even something I understand well myself. Before I start, I would like to say that my conditions aren't near as difficult to live with as many others' and I have no major concerns about my physical health due to them. As much as I intend to keep this positive and helpful, I feel like some expression of my own experiences is needed.

Being depressed is like being trapped in your own head and not being able to control your thoughts or your mood. I usually always have some idea of how to make myself feel better: being with people, having a shower or being outside and walking. I don't lose the knowledge that those things can help. 

What I do lose is all positivity, energy and willpower I have to do them. Every thought in your head turns against you: when someone tries to talk to you, you feel like you are wasting their time; when you consider doing something to take your mind off it you feel like it won't help at all, like you can never escape. Usually you end up hiding away on your own as you're mostly concerned about other people seeing that you're upset, and that (since there's nothing they can really do) you might upset them too. 

For me, this with some combination of anxiety meant that often while I was at university I wouldn't go out, even as far as the shared areas in my own flat outwith my room. It's not something I ever want to experience again, though I know I will. Even though I can articulate what I know I should do just now.

<h2 id="notalone">2. You're Not Alone, and Here's Why</h2>

It is my understanding that with mine and many mental health issues, you feel alone. It is the horrible irony of mental health issues that so many people suffer with them feeling like they're the only one in their position and that no one understands.  But you aren't. You aren't alone.

Throughout my life I have always been quiet, reserved and withdrawn, even with my friends. I never really talked about how I felt as I considered it to be normal for me. This persisted until last year when I started university. In the few months prior to starting university I was beginning to realise that what I thought was normal might not be: long periods of feeling down for no reason; feeling anxious in most social situations even with friends and family. I started to talk about it. I had been interested in mental health before this realisation about myself. Several people close to me have had experiences with mental health issues and my attempts to learn more about it to support them left me knowing what I should do (though it was far from easy when I actually had to put this into practice).

I tried to talk to people about how I was feeling and over time found a few people who I could trust. I won't go into too much detail here, but the people I came to trust were in similar positions to me. They could understand how I felt, and I could understand them too. It surprised me how little was needed to achieve this level of trust. Just a common problem and understanding of how we felt was all that seemed to matter. I'm not so sure that was it though. While, yes, we did understand each other, that's not what I needed when talking to people and that's not all I needed to give.

The friends I made and the people I talked to at university are special simply because they were accepting. Oh, you've been crying for the past three hours? That's okay, I'm here, call me, or meet me tomorrow maybe? Don't have the energy to get food tonight? I'll make some pizza. And here's some Ben and Jerry's. It's these small things that made these people so important to me. We accepted our situations and did the best we could to be happy and support each other. I tried to say it as much as possible but I really can't thank my friends enough for the help they gave me.

This experience is really what made me realise that I'm not alone. I had talked to people online before in a similar way to this, and some have become my good friends. This extra step of finding friends in person who could talk about mental health openly, affectionately and understandingly was a big help for me. No matter how you feel, you're not alone. There are people there who you can talk to and sometimes you just have to open up, spill your feelings, and you'll find them.

The important thing to take away from my story is that mental health is something which affects everyone. You don't have to have a severe condition to be one of the people who can support someone: you just need to listen, be accepting and talk to them. There's no magic answer to mental illness and everyone will find that different things help them, but we can all appreciate some genuine affection sometimes. From my experience, if you are accepting, you'll find the rest follows.

<h2 id="gettinghelp">3. What Starting to Get Help is Like</h2>

Having friends to support me was extremely important. It was something that I didn't take advantage of or notice I had for a long time and I should have. It gives you a solid foundation of support to start from to seek further help. One thing I have experienced is that even when I know what to do, what the next step is, it's significantly more difficult to see it when you're in the situation yourself. You need support to see what to do.

The first thing I did to get help after talking to friends (and before discussing it with my family) was to contact my university's counselling service. They sent me a couple of forms which I filled out and sent back to them. Then they told me to go along next Tuesday at 2pm. I did. I had no idea where I was going, which was fun. I had been in the university library a few times but never on the floor where the counselling service was. Once I found it, after a short detour past some computers, through a wrong door and along a corridor quietly trying to make sure no one heard or saw me, I found it.

`IN PROGRESS: Counselling`

I have never been diagnosed with any mental health condition officially, which may seem odd given that I've described my experience of having and anxiety and clinical depression. I have also visited my doctor about these issues which may confuse you more. This puzzling contradiction leads me on to a story. 

After spending the majority of a year at university going through the motions and trying to keep my mood higher than it wanted to be; after a period of sneaking into the school library on a weekly basis trying not to be seen, sitting nervously in counselling sessions; after several weeks of completely avoiding my studies and socialising to attempt to focus on being happy; after several tense conversations with my parents and trying to stop them from worrying: I came home from university for a break and went to see my doctor. 

Sitting in the small local practice waiting room, looking around anxiously trying not to worry about people thinking I was likely there about my sexual health, I was scared but glad I had taken this step. I was called in. The doctor – a middle-aged man, bald with thin-rimmed glasses which made him look like a philosopher – asked me to sit down. I did, stumbling a little. He asked why I was here and, abruptly realising I would actually have to explain everything I was feeling, I said “I think I have depression,” then waited for his response. After some further discussion of how I was feeling and what had happened at university, and him giving me some things to read, I needed more clarification. Throughout the appointment he had been careful to phrase things like “if you feel like this” or “if you think you have X then Y might help”, without giving any diagnosis. I felt that a professional of what I was experiencing (some firm words validating my concern) would help me to both come to terms with it and encourage me to continue to deal with it. The doctor was reluctant. 

One thing he said gave me hope that I wasn't just being a hormonal, upset teenager. He explained that he was worried about writing in my medical notes that I have depression and anxiety (while casually confirming my suspicions). He explained, with a look of cloaked embarrassment, genuine empathy and intelligence, that if he entered these details in my notes I wouldn't be able to receive any reasoned care in the future. In the 8 minutes a GP has to treat you, if they see a mental health condition and similar symptoms they will prescribe pills. While this can work for some people a tailored, thought-out, case-by-case approach is better and not afforded by the current system. Some people respond well to medicine, some to CBT, some to therapy, some to counselling. My doctor was scared that I wouldn't be treated properly by other doctors in the future and so couldn't diagnose me officially. 

`Explain some of these more fully or link to help and advice section here too?`

To me this signifies not only that mental health isn't something which is discussed openly enough among friends, but also by those in charge of health services, the people who we rely on to get help. Every piece of advice out there suggests that when you talk to someone who hasn't sought help with a mental health condition but thinks they need help, you should help them feel confident enough to talk to their family or close friends, then their doctor. When that important professional step isn't functioning as it should, when doctors are too scared to make a diagnosis because of how that patient will be treated in the future, there is a serious problem. 

In this meeting, my doctor did everything he could to help me and discussed both the issues I was having and the psychology related to them in good detail. However, one of the main things I took away from our discussions was that the system he was working in was not adequately set up to provide help to people with common mental health conditions of a similar level to mine.

This unfortunate story aside, there is lots of help available. While taking the first steps to get help is the most difficult, it is also the most important thing you can do to help yourself. There are people far more experienced than me in the process of seeking help, getting treatment and recovering from mental health disorders, but I can share a few thoughts on getting help.
