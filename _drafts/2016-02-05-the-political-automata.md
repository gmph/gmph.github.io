![On The Political Machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/res/posts/politicalmachine.png)

The levers of power are being pulled right now – up, down, left, right – seized and swapped between the slick, manicured, moisurised hands of the various leaders of Europe. In Downing Street, the Prime Minister's loyal civil servants are waiting to carry out his every command. The campaigning, advertising and propaganda are ready and waiting to be shipped out. The ministers are waiting to fight for the space to challenge the Prime Minister and snatch for power. Newspapers are ready to sell their cases. Large corporations are ready to shower us with press releases. The political class are ready, and the country's fate stands shaking on this mountainous European question: Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?

The action around this referendum shows the political machine we hear about; an all-powerful, all-controlling class which runs our world. These people control your education, your job, your welfare, your rights, your protection, your pension. They control your life. Their backroom deals and mutual greed for power and influence keep them at the top. They are the rulers and you are their servants.

I don't think so. The concept of a “political machine” which is controlled by the wealthy is one which at first makes complete sense. Politicians control law. Businesses control the economy. Media companies change public opinion. This tripartite puzzle seems to fit together snugly to show that the people have lost all control. However, the puzzle begins to fall apart when you look at the effects of the machine.

Politicians control law. Setting and administering policy is the key role of government. It is the government telling its people “this is what you can do, and this is what you cannot”. However, evidence shows that we don't give a fuck about the law. In [an article in _The Telegraph_](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3044794/How-we-all-break-the-law-every-day.html), a poll discusses the fact that the breaking the law is far more a social consideration than a legal one:

>Millions of people who declare themselves innocent law abiding citizens actually commit around seven crimes a week.
>
>More than a third of people are not at all bothered by the fact they are breaking the law, with 58 per cent of those saying the crimes are minor.
>Another 20 per cent don't see them as being illegal because everyone else does it as well.

A more significant example of this effect can be seen in the words of Manuela Carmena, Mayor of Madrid, regarding social attitudes and laws about homosexuality evolving at different paces in Spain. She says:

>I have lived here when if you were gay you would be thrown in prison. Realistically, they haven't especially changed the laws. [...] The law barely changed but people's attitudes did. It was in films, on television, it was in novels. [...] There was a change.

There are many examples of the law and society's general understanding of what is right being offset. Some are archaic and are no longer appropriate. Some are simply not taken seriously. What this does highlight, though, is that the rule of law is by the will of the people – in the collective sense. A person not consenting to an individual law they have broken will not stop action against them. Society's collective non-consent can though.

2P:

- government's general policy also needs consent
- riots in london 2012
- public opinion on Iraq TB
- bedroom tax in Scotland DC
- tax credit cuts GO

Businesses control the economy.

3P:

- history of economic crashes
- the economy is an untamable monster
- policy can control slightly, individuals can benefit, but general it's unpredictable

Media companies control public opinion.

2P:

- the sun hillsborough, shows power of media but also backlash
- the news of the world phone hacking

1P:

- fact is politics is not a machine with rulers controlling servants
- no one is in control, leaders get 5 years of fame and go
- businesses rise then go bust, new people take over
- media companies have to reflect public opinion or lose out

1P:

- political parties are limited by public opinion
- the overton window controls what is acceptable
- it is different in every state but it sets a range of possible policies
- balance of the electorate's views pull left and right to equilibrium

1P:

- while this is democratic it also has another implication
- everything you disagree with, the politicians that annoy you, aren't who you should be angry at
- they reflect the public so it is the public who you should disagree with
- the fact is when you don't agree with the policy, the average view of people doesn't agree with you
- that feeling is not some great evil power, just democracy

1P:

- politics and social views are slow moving
- no one knows what the fuck is going on and no one is in controls
- there is no political machine
- the real machine is an automaton, democracy
- it ensures society controls itself, keeping people within acceptable views, moving those views slowly as an average of the public's opinion
- it requires you to think on a higher level, on a larger scale, to see that no one person matters at all, no politician or businessperson or media mogul
- it doesn't matter what you think or what you disagree with because the equilibrium view is always taken in the end and if you are right that view will move to where you want

1P:

- that doesn't mean you do nothing
- it means the way to cause change is to affect public opinion, talk to people, campaign, get your view across
- change happens slowly in the mind of the public, in the small ideas at a small level, not through politicians with huge titles – they are just part of the automaton, a meaningless, replaceable cog in the system of democracy

If you'd like an alternative view on this topic, I'd suggest reading Owen Jones' _The Establishment_, which sets out a much different view of the “political establishment” (politicians, law-enforcement and the media) and their influence on our lives.
