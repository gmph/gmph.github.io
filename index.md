I tend to think about puppies, pizza and equality. I enjoy being creative: writing, photography, guitar, ukulele and singing occasionally. I'm quiet and thoughtful, and like nature and quiet nights. I'm interested in a combination of technology, design, psychology and sociology. I live in Edinburgh, Scotland. I design apps, websites and some other things. I exist in reality too.

This is a concept by [Wouter de Bres](http://wouterdebr.es), a fantastic designer and psychologist. He was experimenting with using drawings alone for communication, and I reallly like the idea.
