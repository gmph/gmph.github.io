I tend to think about puppies, pizza and equality. I enjoy being creative: writing, taking photos, playing ukulele and singing. I'm quiet and thoughtful. I like nature and quiet nights.

I am a designer with 4 years industry experience working for startups around the world; currently at [Yavi](http://yavi.co) building delightful tools for workers. Previously I worked as a writer and review manager for UltraLinx, and for other online publications.

This is where I publish my thoughts on technology, psychology, politics and more. You can see my most recent articles below.
