I tend to think about puppies, pizza and equality. I enjoy being creative: writing, taking photos, playing ukulele and singing. I'm quiet and thoughtful, and like nature and quiet nights.

I am a designer and front-end developer with 4 years industry experience working with startups around the world; currently with [Snipandshare](http://snipandshare.com). Previously I worked as a writer and review manager for UltraLinx, and other online publications.
